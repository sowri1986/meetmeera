excerpt: "After reading my earlier blog, some of you might wonder, 'Is it really possible to get a autistic child to play in the park or even play together at home?' My answer is a confident yes! If your child isn't playing, it doesn't mean they don't want to, it often means they don't know how to play."

As parents, it's our role to gently introduce them to play and show them how things work, both indoors and outdoors.

To avoid overwhelming, choose off-peak times so there's less pressure and fewer distractions. Use the playground equipment with your child by showing them how to slide, swing, climb, and see how your child responds. Sometimes, you'll be surprised at what they try or master when given a chance at their own pace.

Everyday routines offer so many opportunities:

**Washing vegetables together:** Let your child help you turn the tap on and off, feeling the difference between hot and cold water. This encourages sensory awareness and teaches practical skills. When they try adjusting taps elsewhere in the house, use it as a chance to continue teaching and generalizing the skill.

**Tidying up after play:** Encourage your child to return toys or their favorite items to their proper place. For example, my son loves kitchen utensils and uses them as part of his stim. Afterward, I guide him to return them to their respective place, or help put plates and cutlery into the dishwasher, and wipe down the table after meals. These tasks develop independence, build hand-eye coordination, and improve cognitive growth.

**Laundry tasks:** Involve your child in removing clothes from the washing machine, hanging them to dry with pegs, or sorting laundry. These activities develop both fine motor (peg use) and gross motor (carrying clothes) skills.

**Organizing groceries:** Let your child open packets (using safe scissors), pour rice, pasta, or lentils into jars, and feel the different textures. This builds sensory experience and helps them work through sensitivities to touch and texture.

With patience and creativity, these daily tasks become enjoyable moments of connection and valuable learning. As parents and carers, we truly can nurture our children's independence, sensory processing, and motor skills at home, often in fun and unexpected ways. And sometimes, our children will surprise us. Once, my son pulled over his stepping stool, washed a vegetable cutter I'd left behind, and placed it on the drying rack (all on his own), just by imitating what he'd seen me do.

Everyday life is full of therapy opportunities. By joining your child in these simple routines, you help them grow, gain confidence, and celebrate their unique abilities, one small step at a time. Training them at home playfully on everyday tasks will make them play with you in the park. To them imitation is the game that they are learning from you.
