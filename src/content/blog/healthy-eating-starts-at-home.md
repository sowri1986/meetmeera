excerpt: "Healthy eating habits can be built at home through routines, gentle changes, and family modeling—start small, introduce variety, and use favorites wisely."

As we all know, every skill big or small can be challenging for our children. But while it may be hard, it is always possible. I believe that learning should begin at home, surrounded by parents, grandparents, and siblings. As a family member of a neurodivergent child, we sometimes need to make sacrifices in order to see progress. And just like in many other areas, early intervention can make a real difference in developing healthy eating habits.

Many autistic children are picky eaters. I’ve noticed that a lot of children prefer sweets, crisps, or packaged foods. And because our children often love routines, they tend to stick to the same foods over and over. As parents or carers, we need to know when to maintain a routine and when to gently break it. For example, we should stick to meal times (breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner) but not necessarily serve the same food at every meal.

Think about it! Would we enjoy having the same waffles or crisps three times a day, every day? Of course not! Even our children can get bored of the same food, but they may not know how to express it. That’s where we come in to slowly help them break the cycle. We should always keep in mind to include healthy foods filled with calcium, vitamins and minerals. Initially introduce one new food at a time, when they are ready gradually increase more new food.

### Step 1: Change What You Buy

The first and most important step is to stop buying or storing large amounts of junk food at home. For at least one meal a day, sit together as a family and eat healthy food in front of your child (strictly no gadgets or TV). Let your children see you having healthy food. Initially they might not want to eat. We will also notice some tantrums. Ignore them and start discussing the benefits of healthy food and continue to eat. Your child will go looking for their preferred snack. If they don’t find it, eventually they will reluctantly try what’s available. Don’t worry they won’t be harmed by missing one meal, and trust me it will work.

### Step 2: Use Favorites as a Motivator

For children who are more stubborn or resistant, you can use their favorite snack as a reward for trying new foods. Keep their preferred food out of sight and within your control. For example, if they love crisps, hold a packet in your hand and ask them to eat part of the meal you’ve made first. Once they try it, reward them with a few crisps. Over time, fade out this reward so they no longer expect it. The best time to introduce this method is during a long school holiday because consistency is the most important factor. For some children it will take weeks but for some it will just take a day.

### Step 3: Match Foods to Your Child’s Preferences

When introducing new foods, try to match the texture, taste, or spice level your child prefers. For example, I noticed my son liked crunchy sweets, so I replaced them with homemade nut balls made from dates and dried figs for sweetness. Instead of packaged crisps, I baked sweet potato or regular potato crisps at home.

And always remember variety matters. It is a lot of work to prepare new and healthy options that still appeal to your child’s taste preferences, but the results will make you happy and ready for the next challenge.
