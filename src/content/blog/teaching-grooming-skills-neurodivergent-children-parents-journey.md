As many of you know, my blog focuses on how to engage and support our neurodivergent children at home. Today, I want to talk about a very important life skill, self-grooming, that our children need to learn. There is no doubt they will learn these skills. We just need to be positive, patient, and remember that we often need more time to master each step. It doesn’t mean they won’t succeed; it just means the journey might be longer. Though we will face many struggles along the way, the joy and pride we feel the moment our children reach their goals make it all worthwhile. That's the wonder of our children.

In this blog, I want to share my personal experience helping my son cooperate with two grooming tasks that many parents find challenging, clipping nails and getting haircuts. Like many of you, I was worried, upset, and at times felt hopeless. I read countless books, watched videos, and searched for solutions online. While these resources were helpful, I realized that as a parent, I was my son’s best guide and I am the key to unlock his unique puzzles.

At first, I stuck to advice from one book, then expanded to many books and videos. But eventually, I understood there is no single solution. These were guides for how I might help my son. Some of the books I referred were

* Teaching your child with love and skill : a guide for parents and other educators of children with autism, including moderate to severe autism by Show, Joyce.
* Autism with severe learning difficulties by Jordan, Rita.
* A beginning teacher's guide to special educational needs byWearmouth, Janice.
* Autistic logistics : a parent's guide to tackling bedtime, toilet training, meltdowns, hitting, and other everyday challenges by Wilde, Kate C.

Following some suggestions, I had my son play with a playdough as it is a calming sensory activity that helps desensitize fingers and ease discomfort during grooming. I also softened his nails by wetting his hands and tried clipping one nail a day. Nothing seemed to work. I noticed my son’s fear was unrelated to sensory issues. He was simply afraid of the nail-clipping process itself. Then I learned from a book Autistic logistics, ( Kate C. Wilde is one of my most favourite authors) that we should make our children look at the process of clipping their nails as that will make them know what is happening to them. However when I tried this on my child it did not work. I then took just the idea of making my child realize that it was a painfree process and decided to clip his toenails first where he cannot see it. Gradually, he grew comfortable, and soon allowed me to clip his fingernails. This taught me that understanding my child’s specific fears was more important than following any general advice.

The same was true for haircuts. I tried head massages, deep pressure, using a quieter trimmer, and even having my husband hold my son’s hands while I trimmed, but none worked. What helped was preparing my son in advance by explaining to him that I would cut his hair and showing him how the trimmer worked. That day, he finally cooperated. Later, I introduced the idea of going to a salon by showing pictures, visiting together, and gradually transitioning from home haircuts to salon visits. Of course, some days were challenging, but I realized that these moments were often due to how I approached the situation, not my son. One crucial lesson I learned is that we should never assume our children won’t understand what’s happening. We need to treat them like neurotypical kids, explaining what will happen, what they might enjoy, and what to expect. They deserve to know everything.

Our children’s unique needs call for patience, empathy, and personalized approaches. No book or video has all the answers, only understanding and loving our children can lead us to the right solutions.
